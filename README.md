## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I refreshed my front-end skills after quite a long time. Previously I didn't use Figma to accurately measure the padding, margin, and font sizes but this time I did it and found the design was exactly done as per challenge!
